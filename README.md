# Protein Matching in Python using MPI
The goal of this project is to compare the performance of a serial and parallel protein matching algorithm, specifically highlighting the efficiency gains from parallelism. Through parallelism using MPI there was an observed speedup of 1.69 (Gustafson's law).

Below is a sample output:

<br>The x-axis shows the id of the protein sequence and y-axis shows the number of occurences of the pattern (in this case "ccb") in the protein sequence.
