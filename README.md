# Protein Matching in Python using MPI
- This project highlights a program that matches specific patterns found in a protein sequence file (proteins.csv)
- It compares the performance of the matching algorithm using a serial (serial-proteins.py) and a parallel version (mpi-proteins.py) of the program
